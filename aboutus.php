                <strong>To provide Lebanon with the highest quality computer systems and parts and service at the lowest available prices.</strong><br><br>
                <p>We know which parts work together efficiently. Also, the computer systems we build are custom made to meet your specific technology needs. At SmartX, we determine the exact needs of our customers by figuring out how the customer plans to use the computer; then we provide the many available pricing options.

                <strong>Most components of our systems are independent of one another.</strong><br><br>
                <p>How can a video card be upgraded if it is built into the mainboard? It can’t. If the modem in your system ceases to function, how can you replace it when it is a part of the soundcard? You’ll have to pay the cost of replacing both! Most of the components of Computer Parts systems are independent of one another, which allow you to replace or upgrade at a lower cost. Note that we do incorporate motherboards with built-in components in our offers due to market competitive reasons. Before you buy one of our systems, we’ll explain the maximum technology available for each of our systems.</p>
